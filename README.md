- Responsive design: The cards adjust to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on mobile devices and desktops.
- Choose background color: Users can select their preferred background color for the cards from a set of predefined color options.
- Save preferences: The chosen background color is saved in the user's local storage, so it persists across visits.
