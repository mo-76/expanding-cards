Expanding Cards is a simple and interactive web application that showcases a collection of expandable cards. When clicked, each card expands to reveal more content while the other cards collapse, providing an engaging user experience.

## Features
- Smooth and animated transitions for an interactive feel.
- Customizable content: Easily add your images, text, or any HTML content to the cards.
- Responsive design: The cards adjust to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on mobile devices and desktops.
- Choose background color: Users can select their preferred background color for the cards from a set of predefined color options.
- Save preferences: The chosen background color is saved in the user's local storage, so it persists across visits.
